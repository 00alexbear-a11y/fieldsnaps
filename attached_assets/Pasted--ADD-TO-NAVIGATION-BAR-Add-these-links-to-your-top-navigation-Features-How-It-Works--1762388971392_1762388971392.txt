=== NEW SECTION: "WHY FIELDSNAPS EXISTS" ===
(Insert this RIGHT BEFORE your current pricing section)

Background: White
Padding: 100px vertical
Max-width: 800px centered

**Title (40px semibold, centered)**:
"Why I built FieldSnaps"

**Body Copy (20px, comfortable line-height 1.8, left-aligned or centered)**:

I'm a general contractor. A few years ago, my camera roll was a disaster—
hundreds of job photos mixed with family pictures, impossible to find 
anything when clients asked for updates.

I looked at photo management apps. Every one wanted $1,200+ per year, 
forced me to buy licenses for 3+ users, and came loaded with features 
I'd never touch.

I just wanted to organize my job photos and share them with clients. 
That's it.

So I built FieldSnaps. $19.99 per user. No minimums. No BS.

If you only need one license, you pay for one. If you need 10, you pay 
for 10. No forced bundles. No enterprise sales calls.

Just a tool that does exactly what contractors need—at a price that 
actually makes sense.

=== UPDATE PRICING SECTION ===

Replace your current pricing section with this:

**Small Label Above Title (14px, uppercase, centered)**:
"NO MINIMUMS. NO BS."

**Title (40px semibold, centered)**:
"Pricing that makes sense"

**Subheadline (20px, centered)**:
"Others charge $1,200/year with 3-user minimums. We don't."

**Comparison Table** (simple, clean, centered, max-width 900px):

Overly detailed sections that dilute your message
