🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION: TransistorSoft vs Radar.io
💰 Accurate Pricing Breakdown
TransistorSoft (One-Time Purchase)
Android License: $299 one-time
iOS: FREE (included)
Total: $299 forever
Recurring: $0/month
Radar.io (Managed Service)
Startup Plan: $99/month
Includes: 100K API calls/month
Beyond that: $0.50 per 1,000 extra calls
Total Year 1: $1,188
Total Year 2: $1,188
Total over 5 years: $5,940
🏆 MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION: TransistorSoft
Here's why:

1. Total Cost of Ownership
TransistorSoft: $299 (Year 1) → You own it forever
Radar.io: $1,188/year × 5 years = $5,940
Savings over 5 years: $5,641 with TransistorSoft

2. No Vendor Lock-In
TransistorSoft = you control everything
Radar.io = if they raise prices or shut down, you're stuck
3. Better for Construction Use Case
TransistorSoft: Built for apps that need offline capability (jobsites have spotty signal)
Radar.io: Cloud-based service (requires reliable internet)
4. Privacy Control
TransistorSoft: All location data stays on your servers
Radar.io: Location data goes through their servers first
5. You're Technical Enough
You're already building a Capacitor app
Installing TransistorSoft plugin is straightforward
Replit can handle the integration
⚠️ When Radar.io Makes Sense
Radar.io would be better if:

❌ You had zero technical team (you have Replit + you)
❌ You needed enterprise-level 99.99% uptime guarantees
❌ You were tracking 1000+ users (scale complexity)
❌ You wanted someone else to maintain everything
But you don't fit that profile. You're bootstrapping, technical, and cost-conscious.

💪 FINAL DECISION: Buy TransistorSoft for $299
Here's what you get:

✅ Lifetime license (no recurring fees)
✅ Full control of your data
✅ Works offline on job sites
✅ Best battery optimization in the industry
✅ Active support forum
✅ Updates included
