- I am testing all of these features in preview on the dev tab, here is our list of corrections.
- First it still shows uploads pending, it looks like its having a hard time Uploading  things to their projects.
- In projects view, when i hit the side panel, and hit any of those options it needs to close our side menu. for example if i hit sort by name it needs to sort by that desired selection and close the side menu. Also when in projects view when i scroll on our top menu it scrolls the top menu, it needs to keep the top menu in place always, it looks like we have 2 scroll fields. only the projects under our search bar down to our buttons needs to scroll in this view, the top menu should be stuck to the top.
- When in live tracking what does the amount of minutes mean? is that last active? i dont think we need that Tracking system. it should be just as live to location as we can have without draining the battery too much. so whatever teh geo settings are for how often we are tracking. This view needs to be accessible as a in “locations” view in the admins account. so the can access that same map of locations there.
- When i hit time sheets i get a network error
- Teh slide oue menu that we have feels too abrupt at the top the way it squares off, we need to find a diffrent approach. maybe we make the while a little transparent at the edges and break our hard edge? How would apple do this? this needs to be a universal fix that is applied in all pop up menus.
- In activity mode i should be able to sort by user and by project.
- In to do List The pop that comes up above the keyboard, lets make all the selections and options fit between teh keyboarrd and our top menu. I dont want this to be scrollable. it seems too cluttered, i dont think we need that checkback with those up and down scrollables. when i try to add a photo to a task it shuts down the task i am trying to create instead of inserting the photo and continuing the task. The animation  for a task complete is not working properly, it should feel much more satisfying. how would apple do this so its satisfying for completing a task. when i hit the calander to see tasks within the to do list there are 2 “x”s at teh top right to close. not sure why.
- In locations there needs to be a button that i can click to zoom to  me. im not sure what it is sorting by distance, distance from me? i don think that is needed. also i think this should only show active jobs, withe the option to view compleated jobs there as well.
- time view, i think it would be nice to auto detect if we are near aproject and a notification comes up that says would you like to clock in? or something along those lines, the admin can choose to set suggested clock i think in settings. also i want to confirm we are auto tracking hours at each job, travel time and automatically swithing between them etc.. also it would be really cool to have a little travel map of the driving / jobs you visited that you can see when you clock out that goes on to the time card. if this is too mcuh we dont have to do it. but it would be a nice featuer, jsut not sure how it would work without service, so it could populate when it has service and not when it does not.
- Camera view, when selecting a project in camera mode we need to remove the maps button icon on the projet, the camera icon an the 3 dots. since already know they are inteding to take photos we dont need those features there. in camera mode i dont want notifications that something was saved successfully i like see in edit mode when i hit save. it makes it feel like we expected it to fail. also when i hit the camera button from camera mode to edit mnode i get a network error. since we only have tags and unit number lets just have that checkbox jsut show tags instead of both. i dont want another pop up screen on the camera tabs. so the quick actions menu would go away and it would just be our auto tags. to access the unit number on the jobs taht have multiple uunits we can add a littel transparent “Unit #” on the bottom right of the preview screen in line with the zoom buttons. When in camera settings i dont think any of those options change anything, i dont see a grid overlay. the pdf mode does not do anything, and teh auto save needs to be gone, it should never need to confirm they save it should always be on. also. idont see the ability to choose which ratio of photo i want. i think we talked about having 2 options. when i just took a bunch of photos they did not upload, and when i go to setting to try to syn now nothing happens, they just say pending. not sure why.
