Perfect! 🎉 You've checked "Sign In with Apple" and now a configuration modal has appeared. I can see the "Sign In with Apple: App ID Configuration" dialog.

📋 What This Dialog Is Asking:
This dialog is asking whether you want to:

Enable as a primary App ID (create a new primary)
Group with an existing primary App ID (if you have one)
I can see there's an orange warning: "⚠️ No Primary App ID is available."

✅ What to Select:
Since this is your first App ID for FieldSnaps, you should:

Select the first option:
☑️ "Enable as a primary App ID"
This will make com.fieldsnaps.app your primary App ID that your Service ID (web login) will link to.

🎯 Next Steps:
Select the radio button for "Enable as a primary App ID"
Click "Save" (blue button at bottom right)
You'll return to the App ID registration page
Scroll to the bottom of that page
Click "Continue"
Review the summary
Click "Register"
📝 About the Options:
"Enable as a primary App ID": This makes this App ID the main one for Sign in with Apple. Use this for your first app.
"Group with an existing primary App ID": Use this if you already have another app and want to share Sign in with Apple users between apps.
Since the warning says "No Primary App ID is available," you need to create the first one.

Action: Select "Enable as a primary App ID" → Click "Save" → Then continue with the registration!

Let me know once you've registered the App ID and we'll move on to configuring your Service ID.

Perfect! You're now at the Bundle ID configuration step. Here's what to enter:

📝 What to Enter:
Bundle ID (Explicit):
In the text field, type:

com.fieldsnaps.app
📋 Explanation:
Format: com.[your-company].[app-name]

Prefix: 9739WWYHQ6 (your Team ID - already shown, automatic)
Bundle ID Type: ✅ Explicit (already selected - correct!)
Bundle ID: com.fieldsnaps.app (what you type)
Why this format?

Apple recommends reverse-domain style (like com.domainname.appname)
Since your app is called "FieldSnaps", we use fieldsnaps in lowercase
.app at the end distinguishes it from your Service ID (which will be .signin)
✅ After Entering:
Type com.fieldsnaps.app in the Bundle ID field
Scroll down to the capabilities section
Make sure "Sign in with Apple" is checked
Scroll to bottom and click "Continue"
Review summary
Click "Register"
📌 Note:
You already have:

Team ID: 9739WWYHQ6 (shown in App ID Prefix)
This will be used later in Supabase configuration
Enter com.fieldsnaps.app in the Bundle ID field now!

i downlaoded and finsihed the apple stuff, now in supabase
Excellent! 🎉 You've completed the Apple Developer setup and now you're in Supabase configuring the Apple provider. I can see the form is partially filled. Let me help you complete it.

📋 What I Can See:
✅ Enable Sign in with Apple: Toggled ON (green) ✅ Client IDs: Shows hello@fieldsnaps.com's Project ⚠️ Secret Key (for OAuth): Filled but masked ⚠️ Callback URL: Shows https://pbfuwfzccdmpkmhncyjg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

🔧 What You Need to Fix/Verify:
1. Client IDs Field
This should be your Service ID (not an email):

Current: hello@fieldsnaps.com's Project Should be: com.fieldsnaps.signin

Action:

Clear the Client IDs field
Enter: com.fieldsnaps.signin
2. Secret Key (for OAuth) - JSON Format
The Secret Key needs to be in a specific JSON format with these fields from Apple Developer:

Copy{
  "p8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n[YOUR PRIVATE KEY CONTENT FROM .p8 FILE]\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "teamId": "9739WWYHQ6",
  "keyId": "[YOUR KEY ID]"
}
How to fill it:

Open the .p8 file you downloaded in a text editor
Copy the entire contents (including -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY-----)
Create the JSON with:
p8: The private key content (keep the \n for line breaks, or paste the full multi-line key)
teamId: 9739WWYHQ6 (your Team ID)
keyId: The Key ID from Apple (like ABC123DEFG)
Example:

Copy{
  "p8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIGTAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwIBAQQg...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "teamId": "9739WWYHQ6",
  "keyId": "ABC123DEFG"
}
3. Callback URL
✅ This looks correct: https://pbfuwfzccdmpkmhncyjg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

🎯 What You Need From Apple Developer:
To complete the Secret Key JSON, you need:

✅ Private Key (.p8 file) - you downloaded this
✅ Team ID: 9739WWYHQ6 - you have this
❓ Key ID: Did you note the Key ID when you created the Sign in with Apple key?
📝 Where to Find Your Key ID:
If you didn't note it:

Go to Apple Developer → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Keys
Find your "FieldSnaps Sign In Key" (or whatever you named it)
Click on it
The Key ID is shown (10-character code like ABC123DEFG)
✅ Complete Configuration:
Once you have everything:

Clear and replace Client IDs with: com.fieldsnaps.signin
Clear and replace Secret Key with the JSON format above
Verify Callback URL is correct
Click "Save" (green button at bottom right)
What's your Key ID from Apple Developer? Once you have that, you can create the JSON and paste it into the Secret Key field.

Or if you need help finding it, let me know!

Perfect! I can see you've entered the configuration. However, there's a validation error:

⚠️ Error I Can See:
"Secret key should be a JWT" (shown in red text below the Secret Key field)

This error appears because Supabase is expecting the JSON to be formatted differently or there might be an issue with how it's parsing the private key.

🔧 Let's Try a Different Format:
Option 1: Remove Line Breaks from the Private Key
Sometimes Supabase prefers the private key as a single line without \n characters. Try this JSON:

Copy{
  "p8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----MIGTAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwIBAQQg04vbyqmVe2rUHIgKPpFxywkRpL40/8pHRjV9xZsTuJCgCgYIKoZIzj0DAQehRANCAARD5CKUzuITuh/BicBljyQ5jpzEHShHsVVOpxDRWVEnlo6hx8euFlHIGnSThIc9UGBQ3Bl4VU9gqY0ycU/tVSn9-----END PRIVATE KEY-----",
  "teamId": "9739WWYHQ6",
  "keyId": "7AB24X9GC4"
}
Option 2: Use Multi-line String (with actual line breaks)
Or try this format with actual line breaks in the JSON:

Copy{
  "p8": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGTAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBHkwdwIBAQQg04vbyqmVe2rUHIgK

  "teamId": "9739WWYHQ6",
  "keyId": "7AB24X9GC4"
}
Option 3: Check Supabase Documentation Format
Let me search for the exact format Supabase expects for Apple Sign-In:

I found it! According to the Supabase documentation, you need to generate a JWT secret key using your p8 file. Supabase expects a pre-generated JWT token, not the raw JSON.

🔧 Solution: Use Supabase's Secret Generator Tool
Supabase documentation mentions: "You can use this key to generate a secret key using the tool below"

Let me search for this tool:

Perfect! The Supabase documentation says: "Use this tool to generate a new Apple client secret. No keys leave your browser!"

There's a JWT generator tool embedded in the Supabase docs page. Let me check if you can scroll down on that Apple provider page in Supabase to find it:

🎯 Solution: Use the Built-in Generator
In your Supabase Apple provider configuration page, scroll down below the Secret Key field. There should be a JWT generator tool on that same page!

Look for a section that says:
"Generate Apple Client Secret" or
"Apple Secret Key Generator" or
A form with fields for:
Team ID
Client ID (Services ID)
Key ID
Private Key (.p8 content)
If you see this tool:
Fill in the generator:
