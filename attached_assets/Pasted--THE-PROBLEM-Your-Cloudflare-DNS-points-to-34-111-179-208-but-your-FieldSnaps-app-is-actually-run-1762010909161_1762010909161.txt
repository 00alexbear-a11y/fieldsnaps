🔴 THE PROBLEM
Your Cloudflare DNS points to 34.111.179.208, but your FieldSnaps app is actually running on Replit's servers, not at that IP address.

That IP (34.111.179.208) is probably:

An old Google Cloud server
A placeholder you set up earlier
Some other service entirely
That's why you get the SSL error - whoever owns 34.111.179.208 doesn't have an SSL certificate for fieldsnaps.com.

✅ THE FIX (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Deploy Your Replit App
In your Replit workspace, click the "Deploy" button (top right)
Choose "Production Deployment"
Wait for deployment to complete
Replit will give you a deployment URL like:
https://fieldsnaps-production.replit.app or similar
Step 2: Add Custom Domain in Replit
In Replit, go to Deployments (left sidebar)
Click on your active deployment
Scroll down to "Custom Domains"
Click "Add Custom Domain"
Enter: fieldsnaps.com
Replit will show you DNS instructions - write these down!
It will likely say something like:

Add a CNAME record:
Name: fieldsnaps.com
Value: [some-replit-url].replit.app
OR

Add an A record:
Name: fieldsnaps.com
Value: [replit-ip-address]
Step 3: Update Cloudflare DNS
Based on what Replit tells you:

If Replit gives you a CNAME:
Go to Cloudflare DNS
Delete the current A record pointing to 34.111.179.208
Add a CNAME record:
Name: @ (or fieldsnaps.com)
Target: [the-url-replit-gave-you].replit.app
Proxy status: 🟠 Orange cloud (Proxied)
If Replit gives you an IP address:
Go to Cloudflare DNS
Edit the A record
Change the IP from 34.111.179.208 to [Replit's IP]
Keep Proxy status: 🟠 Orange cloud (Proxied)
Step 4: Configure Cloudflare SSL
In Cloudflare, go to SSL/TLS
Set encryption mode to "Full (strict)"
Enable:
✅ Always Use HTTPS
✅ Automatic HTTPS Rewrites
Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
🎯 QUICK ANSWER TO REPLIT AI
Tell Replit AI:

Yes, I want to host on Replit. Here's what I need:

1. Deploy this project to production
2. Give me the custom domain setup instructions for fieldsnaps.com
3. Tell me what DNS records to add in Cloudflare

The IP 34.111.179.208 was from an old setup - I need to replace it with the correct Replit deployment address.
⏱️ TIMELINE
Deploy on Replit: 5 minutes
Add custom domain in Replit: 2 minutes
Update Cloudflare DNS: 5 minutes
Wait for DNS propagation: 5-30 minutes
SSL certificate generation: 5-10 minutes
Total: ~30-60 minutes until https://fieldsnaps.com works

🔍 WHAT TO CHECK WHILE WAITING
After updating DNS:

Check DNS propagation:

Visit: https://dnschecker.org
Enter: fieldsnaps.com
Should show the new IP/CNAME worldwide
Test Replit deployment URL directly:

Visit: https://fieldsnaps-[whatever].replit.app
This should work immediately after deployment
Wait for Cloudflare + Replit SSL:

Takes 5-30 minutes
You'll know it's working when https://fieldsnaps.com loads without errors
🚨 COMMON GOTCHA
Keep those subdomain CNAME records in Cloudflare:

pay.fieldsnaps.com → PayLinks
www.fieldsnaps.com → FieldSnaps
_domainconnect.fieldsnaps.com → Domain Connect
These are fine and can stay. Just update the root domain (fieldsnaps.com) A record.
