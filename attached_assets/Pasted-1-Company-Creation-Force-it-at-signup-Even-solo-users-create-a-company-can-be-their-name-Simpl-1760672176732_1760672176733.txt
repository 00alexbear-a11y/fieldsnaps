1. Company Creation: Force it at signup. Even solo users create a company (can be their name). Simpler data model.

2. Invite Security: Links expire after 5 uses OR 7 days (whichever comes first). Owner can revoke and generate new link. Balance of convenience vs security.

3. Billing Owner Invites: Only the billing owner (original account creator) can invite users. Promoted owners get admin powers except inviting. Prevents surprise charges.

4. Removed Members: 7-day grace period with read-only access. Notification sent: "You've been removed from [Company]. You have 7 days to export your data." After 7 days, access revoked.

5. Camera Task Assignment: Replace dropdown with quick tap buttons showing team members. Example: [Mike] [John] [Sarah] [Me] [+More]. Glove-friendly, fast.

6. Subscription Status: Remove user.subscription_status. Derive access from companies.subscription_status only. User has access if their company.subscription_status = 'active'. Single source of truth.

7. Edge Cases:

Payment fails → 3-day grace period, banner notification, then lock access until payment updated
Owner cancels → Warning about team impact, 30-day read-only export window, then archive
Member leaves voluntarily → "Leave Team" button, owner notified, billing reduces next cycle
Last owner protection → Cannot demote self if last owner, must promote someone else first
Updated database:

companies table:
- subscription_status (only subscription state that matters)
- invite_link_token (regenerate on revoke)
- invite_link_uses (track how many joined)
- invite_link_expires_at (7 days from generation)

users table:
- company_id (if null = no company yet, shouldn't happen after forced creation)
- role (owner/member)
- removed_at (timestamp, for grace period tracking)
- Remove: subscription_status field
