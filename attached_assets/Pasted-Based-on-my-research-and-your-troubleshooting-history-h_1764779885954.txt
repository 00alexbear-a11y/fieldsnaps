Based on my research and your troubleshooting history, here's a comprehensive diagnostic plan to solve this 403 error:

🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The Error 403: access_denied from Google OAuth typically occurs due to one of these issues:

Redirect URI mismatch (even subtle differences)
Client ID/Secret mismatch between Google and Supabase
OAuth consent screen misconfiguration
Cache/session issues
Domain verification issues
🎯 Systematic Debugging Plan
Phase 1: Verify Exact Redirect URIs (Most Common Issue)
Let me check what's actually being sent during the OAuth flow:

Action Steps:

Open your Replit app in a new incognito/private window
Open Browser DevTools (F12 → Network tab)
Click "Continue with Google"
Look at the failed request in the Network tab
Find the redirect_uri parameter in the request URL
What to verify:

Does the redirect_uri in the request exactly match what's in Google Cloud Console?
Check for:
http vs https
Trailing slashes (/auth/callback vs /auth/callback/)
Port numbers
Subdomain differences
Phase 2: Double-Check Google Cloud Console Setup
Go back to Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Your OAuth Client:

Verify these exact URIs are added:

https://pbfuwfzccdmpkmhncyjg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
Also check if you need:

https://[your-replit-url].repl.co/auth/callback
⚠️ Common mistake: Google Cloud shows the Supabase URI, but your code might be redirecting to your Replit domain.

Phase 3: Verify Supabase Configuration
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:

Check these settings:

Site URL: Should be your Replit app URL (e.g., https://your-app.repl.co)
Redirect URLs: Add BOTH:
https://your-replit-app.repl.co/*
https://pbfuwfzccdmpkmhncyjg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
Phase 4: Verify Client Credentials Match
In Google Cloud Console:

Go to Credentials
Click on your OAuth client
Copy the Client ID shown
In Supabase:

Go to Authentication → Providers → Google
Verify the Client ID matches exactly
Do the same for Client Secret.

Phase 5: Check Your Code's OAuth Implementation
In your Replit code, verify how you're calling Supabase auth:

Copy// The redirectTo parameter MUST match what's in Google Console
await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
  options: {
    redirectTo: 'https://your-actual-replit-url.repl.co/auth/callback'
    // NOT localhost:3000
  }
})
Phase 6: Clear Everything and Start Fresh
If none of the above works:

In Google Cloud Console:

Delete the existing OAuth client
Create a NEW OAuth client
Add redirect URI: https://pbfuwfzccdmpkmhncyjg.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
Copy new Client ID and Secret
In Supabase:

Disable Google provider
Enable it again with the NEW credentials
Save
Clear browser cache or use incognito

Restart your Replit server

🎬 Immediate Action Plan
Do this RIGHT NOW:

Open Network Tab (F12) in your browser
Try the Google login
Find the failed request
Take a screenshot of:
The request URL (showing the redirect_uri parameter)
The response error
This will tell us exactly what redirect URI your app is sending vs. what Google expects.

Can you do this and share what you see in the Network tab? This is the fastest way to identify the exact mismatch.
