Context: FieldSnaps is a photo documentation app for contractors. Users organize work into projects/jobs. We need to add a lightweight task management system where team leaders can assign photo documentation tasks to crew members. Tasks are part of the job they belong to - they live and die with that job.

What We're Building: A dead-simple task list for each job that helps small contractor crews (1-5 people) coordinate who needs to take which photos. This isn't project management software - it's just a way to assign and track basic photo-related tasks without endless group texts.

Core Requirements:

1. Job-Centric Task Lists

Every job has its own task list
Tasks only exist within a job (they're not independent)
When viewing a job, you see its task list
Task count visible on job card: "Duplex Remodel - 41 photos, 3 tasks"
2. Task Assignment

Create task with simple flow: Task name → Assign to team member → Done
Example tasks: "Get foundation photos", "Document electrical rough-in", "Take final walkthrough shots"
One task assigned to one person
Boss/admin can assign tasks to any team member
3. View Modes (Toggle)

"My Tasks" - shows only tasks assigned to me across all active jobs
"All Tasks" - shows all tasks for this specific job
Easy toggle switch between views
Badge count showing number of incomplete tasks
4. Task Completion

Single tap checkbox to mark task done
Task disappears from active list immediately (smooth animation)
Task marked complete in database (not deleted)
No confirmation needed - keep it fast
5. Completed Tasks View

Separate section: "View Completed Tasks"
Shows tasks marked done with timestamp
Can restore a completed task back to active (undo button)
Keeps task history for documentation
6. Notifications

Push notification when assigned a task: "[Boss Name] assigned you: [Task Name]"
Tapping notification opens that job's task list
Only notification type - no other alerts
7. Camera Integration (Quick Task Creation)

Add "+ Task" button in camera interface (top bar or three-dot menu)
Tapping opens minimal modal overlay without exiting camera
Modal contains only 2 fields:
Task name (text input, keyboard opens immediately)
Assign to (dropdown of team members)
Task automatically associates with current project/job being photographed
On create: Modal closes instantly, returns to camera
Purpose: Team leader spots something needing follow-up while shooting, assigns task immediately without breaking workflow
Keep modal design minimal and fast - jobsite use case requires speed
Job Lifecycle Behavior:

When a job is marked complete:

All incomplete tasks automatically marked complete
Job + all tasks move to "Completed Jobs" view
Tasks remain visible when viewing completed job (for records)
No data is deleted - just archived
User can toggle "Show Completed Jobs" to see history
When a job is deleted:

Warning dialog appears: "⚠️ Delete [Job Name]? This will permanently delete: [X] photos, [Y] tasks (Z incomplete), all project data. This cannot be undone."
User must confirm deletion
On confirm: Job and ALL associated tasks are permanently deleted (cascade delete)
Prevents orphaned tasks in database
Key principle: Tasks are children of jobs. They don't exist independently. When the job goes away (completed or deleted), tasks go with it.

User Flows:

Adding a task from job view:

Open job detail page
Scroll to "Tasks" section
Tap "+ Add Task"
Enter task name
Select team member from dropdown
Tap "Create" - done
Adding a task from camera (NEW):

In camera mode shooting photos for a job
Spot something needing follow-up documentation
Tap "+ Task" button in camera UI
Minimal modal appears over camera view
Type task name (e.g., "Get final electrical panel shots")
Select team member to assign
Tap "Create"
Modal closes, back to camera instantly
Task created and linked to current job
Completing a task:

See task in list with checkbox
Tap checkbox once
Task fades out and disappears
Moves to "Completed Tasks" section
Viewing my work across all jobs:

Toggle to "My Tasks" view
See all tasks assigned to me from all active jobs
Grouped by job name
Complete tasks right from this view
Restoring a completed task:

Open "View Completed Tasks"
Find the task
Tap restore icon
Task moves back to active list
What NOT to Build:

❌ No due dates or deadlines
❌ No priority levels (high/medium/low)
❌ No subtasks or dependencies
❌ No comments or discussion threads (crews use text)
❌ No time tracking
❌ No calendar integration
❌ No task templates
❌ No recurring tasks
❌ No attachments to tasks
Keep it minimal. This is a task checklist, not a project management suite.

Technical Requirements:

Database Schema:

tasks table:
- id (primary key)
- job_id (foreign key to jobs table, ON DELETE CASCADE)
- task_name (text)
- assigned_to (user_id foreign key)
- completed (boolean, default false)
- completed_at (timestamp, nullable)
- created_at (timestamp)
- created_by (user_id)
Key behaviors:

ON DELETE CASCADE: When job is deleted, all tasks delete automatically
Completed tasks: Set completed = true, don't delete from database
Restore task: Set completed = false, clear completed_at timestamp
Camera-created tasks automatically get job_id from current active camera session
Performance:

Index on job_id for fast lookup
Index on assigned_to for "My Tasks" view
Query optimization for showing only active vs completed tasks
UI/UX Requirements:

Visual Design:

Clean, minimal interface
Tasks displayed as simple list items with checkbox
Smooth fade-out animation when completing
Clear visual separation between active and completed tasks
Mobile-optimized (primary use case is on jobsite with phone)
Camera modal overlay should be lightweight and non-intrusive
Task List Appearance:

Interactions:

Tap checkbox → mark complete (immediate)
Tap task text → view details (who assigned, when created)
Swipe left → delete option (admin only)
Long press → quick reassign to different person
Camera task button → modal overlay (doesn't exit camera)
Success Criteria:

This feature succeeds if:

✅ Team leader can assign a task in under 10 seconds
✅ Team member can mark task complete in 1 tap
✅ "My Tasks" view shows everything assigned to me across all jobs
✅ No orphaned tasks when jobs are deleted
✅ Interface doesn't feel cluttered or overwhelming
✅ Crew members understand it without training
✅ Can create task from camera without breaking workflow (camera integration)
Goal: Make task coordination faster than sending group texts, without adding complexity that requires a tutorial. Camera integration makes it seamless to assign follow-up work while in the field.

Integration Points:

Tasks section appears in job detail view (below photos and map)
Home screen shows task count badge on job cards
Camera interface includes "+ Task" button (top bar or menu)
Bottom nav could have "Tasks" tab showing "My Tasks" across all jobs (optional)
Push notifications use existing notification system
Build this as a focused feature that justifies multiple team members on one account. Keep it stupid simple. Tasks exist to coordinate photo documentation - nothing more. The camera integration is key for real-world jobsite use where the boss spots something needing documentation while actively shooting photos
