Create a minimalist, Apple-inspired homepage for FieldSnaps - a construction photo organization app.

=== DESIGN PHILOSOPHY ===
- Apple-level simplicity with clean, breathable white space
- Typography: San Francisco or Inter font (48-72px headlines, 18-20px body)
- Color palette: Pure white background, charcoal text (#1d1d1f), ONE accent color (construction orange #FF6B35 or slate blue #34495e)
- Generous padding/margins (80-120px vertical spacing between sections)
- Maximum content width: 1200px centered
- NO gradients, NO shadows (except subtle card shadows), NO clutter

=== HERO SECTION ===
Full viewport height, centered content

**Headline (72px bold)**: 
"Organize job photos.  
Separate work from home."

**Subheadline (24px, light weight, muted gray)**:
"For contractors, project managers, and property owners who need construction documentation they can actually find."

**Hero Visual**:
Create a clean split-screen mockup:
- LEFT side (40% width): Blurred/faded iOS camera roll showing chaos - mix of personal photos (kids, food, random screenshots) with construction photos all jumbled
- RIGHT side (60% width): Sharp, clean FieldSnaps app interface showing organized project folders with professional construction photo thumbnails

**CTA Buttons** (centered, 60px spacing between):
- Primary: "Start Free Trial" (solid accent color, 16px padding, rounded corners)
- Secondary: "See How It Works" (outline style, arrow icon →)

=== FEATURES SECTION ===
Background: Very light gray (#f5f5f7)
Padding: 120px vertical

**Section Title (48px, centered)**: "Built for the field"

**3 Feature Cards** (equal width, horizontal layout, subtle white cards):

1. **Smart Organization**
   Icon: 📁 (or folder icon)
   "Automatically organize by project, date, or custom tags. Never lose a photo again."

2. **Instant Search**
   Icon: 🔍 (or search icon)
   "Find any photo in seconds. Search by project name, date, or even what's in the photo."

3. **Private & Secure**
   Icon: 🔒 (or lock icon)
   "Your job photos stay separate from personal photos. Cloud backup included."

=== SHOWCASE SECTION ===
Background: Pure white
Padding: 120px vertical

**Large App Screenshot** (centered, 80% width):
Show FieldSnaps mobile app interface displaying a construction project gallery with these photo categories visible:
- "Framing Progress"
- "Tile Detail Work"
- "Landscape Install"
- "Electrical Rough-In"
- "Foundation Pour"

Use realistic construction photo thumbnails showing:
- Wood framing (studs, joists)
- Detailed tile work (close-up)
- Landscaping in progress
- Electrical conduit/wiring
- Professional finish work

**Caption below (20px, centered, muted)**: 
"From rough-ins to finish work, keep every detail documented."

=== PRICING SECTION ===
Background: Very light gray (#f5f5f7)
Padding: 120px vertical

**Section Title (48px, centered)**: "Simple pricing"

**Single Pricing Card** (centered, max-width 500px, white background):
- Price: "$19.99" (64px bold)
- "/user/month" (20px, muted)
- "No user minimum" (14px, muted, italic)
- Vertical spacing then list features (18px each):
  ✓ Unlimited photos
  ✓ Unlimited projects
  ✓ Cloud backup & sync
  ✓ Advanced search
  ✓ Team sharing
  ✓ Export & reporting

**Small note below card (14px, gray)**:

=== FOOTER ===
Background: Dark gray (#1d1d1f)
Text: Light gray
Padding: 60px vertical

Simple centered layout:
- "© 2025 FieldSnaps. All rights reserved."
- Links: Privacy | Terms | Support | Contact

=== TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ===
- Mobile responsive (stack sections vertically on <768px)
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Hero CTA buttons should have subtle hover effects (slight scale/shadow)
- Load hero section first, lazy-load images below fold
- Optimize all images for web (WebP format)
- Font loading: System fonts with fallback (San Francisco, -apple-system, Inter, Helvetica)

=== IMAGE PLACEHOLDERS TO GENERATE ===
For the construction photos in the showcase section, use realistic imagery showing:
1. Interior framing - wooden studs and joists (bright, well-lit)
2. Bathroom tile detail - clean grout lines, professional finish
3. Landscape installation - fresh mulch, new plants, outdoor work
4. Electrical rough-in - conduit, junction boxes, neat wiring
5. Detailed finish work - trim, molding, or cabinetry close-ups

All photos should look professional but authentic - like real contractor documentation, not stock photography.

=== BRAND VOICE ===
- Calm, confident, professional
- No hype or exclamation marks
- Short sentences, clear benefits
- Speak to the pain point: "Can't find that photo from last week's inspection? We fix that."
