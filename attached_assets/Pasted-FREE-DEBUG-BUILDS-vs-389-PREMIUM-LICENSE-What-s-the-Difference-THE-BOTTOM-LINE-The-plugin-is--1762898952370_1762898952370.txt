✅ Android Debug: Same as free
✅ Android Release: NOW WORKS - can publish to Google Play Store

You ONLY need the $389 license when:

You want to release a production Android app to customers
🚀 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:

❓ COMMON QUESTIONS:
Q: Can I test the full feature set for free?
A: YES! Android debug builds have 100% of features enabled.

Q: Do I need to buy the license to test on real Android phones?
A: NO! Just install debug APKs via USB. They work perfectly.

Q: What happens if I try to publish without a license?
A: The Android release build won't work - tracking will fail to start or crash.

Q: Is iOS always free?
A: YES! iOS never requires a license (debug or release).

Q: Will the "License Validation Failure" toast affect my testing?
A: NO - it's just a harmless warning. The plugin works 100% normally in debug builds.

Q: Can I get a refund if it doesn't work?
A: No refunds, BUT you can test everything FREE first before buying, so there's zero risk.

Q: Do I need to pay annually?
A: NO! $389 is one-time payment. Includes 1 year of updates, but plugin continues working forever.

💰 ACTUAL COST BREAKDOWN:
If you test first (RECOMMENDED):
Weeks 1-8: $0 (free development & testing)
Week 9: $389 (only when ready to publish)
Total: $389
If you buy immediately:
Day 1: $389 (same features as free, just removes toast message)
Waste: $0 (but you could have tested free first)
🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION:
START FREE, BUY LATER:

Don't buy the license yet
Build the entire feature using FREE debug builds
Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android (debug)
Show it to your buddy who uses Construction Clock
Get 10 real contractors to test it (send debug APKs)
ONLY buy the $389 license when you're 100% confident and ready to publish to Google Play Store
This way:

✅ Zero financial risk
✅ You test everything before committing
✅ You validate the feature works for contractors
✅ You only pay when you're ready to launch
⚠️ ONE CAVEAT:
The toast message "License Validation Failure" will show on Android debug builds. Your developers will see it during testing. Just tell them to ignore it - it's normal and doesn't affect functionality.

TL;DR: The free debug builds give you 100% of features to fully test FieldSnaps. You only need the $389 license to publish the Android app to production. iOS is always free.

Should you buy now? No. Test first with free debug builds, then buy when you're ready to launch.
