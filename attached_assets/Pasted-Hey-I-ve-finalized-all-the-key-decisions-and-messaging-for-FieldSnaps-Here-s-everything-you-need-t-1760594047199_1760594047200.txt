Story/Subheadline:

When I started my business, I looked at CompanyCam and other tools. 
They had great features, but the pricing didn't make sense for a solo 
operator. The cheap alternatives were frustrating to use.

I wanted professional features without paying for enterprise bloat 
or forced user minimums.

So I built FieldSnaps - the tool I wish existed when I started.

  // Show upgrade modal
}

Webhook Implementation:
Endpoint: https://fieldsnaps.com/api/webhooks/stripe

CRITICAL: Verify webhook signatures for security:

Copyconst sig = request.headers['stripe-signature'];
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  request.body,
  sig,
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
);
Events to handle:

1. checkout.session.completed (User subscribed)

Copy// Update database:
user.subscriptionStatus = 'active'
user.stripeCustomerId = session.customer
user.stripeSubscriptionId = session.subscription
user.trialEndDate = null

// Log event in subscriptionEvents table
// Send "Payment Success" email
2. invoice.payment_succeeded (Recurring payment successful)

Copy// Ensure subscriptionStatus = 'active'
// Log successful payment
// Continue service
3. invoice.payment_failed (Payment failed)

Copy// Day 0: Show notification bar in app
// Send email: "Payment failed, we'll retry"
// Notification: "Payment issue - update payment method"

// Day 7: Send reminder email

// Day 14: Set subscriptionStatus = 'past_due'
// Soft block activates (read-only mode)
// Show modal: "Update Payment Method to Continue"
// [Update Payment] button → Stripe Customer Portal
4. customer.subscription.deleted (User canceled)

Copy// Set subscriptionStatus = 'canceled'
// Send cancellation confirmation email
// Soft block activates (read-only mode)
Failed Payment Handling:
Grace Period: 2 weeks (14 days)

Timeline:

Day 0: Payment fails → Notification bar + email
Day 7: Reminder email
Day 14: Soft block + "Update Payment" modal
Notification Bar (Days 0-14):

We couldn't process your payment for FieldSnaps. No worries - 
this happens sometimes when cards expire or have insufficient funds.

You can update your payment method in Settings → Subscription.

your account will be in read-only mode until payment is updated.

❓ QUESTIONS FOR YOU:
Stripe Customer Portal: I recommend enabling it so users can self-serve billing management. Should I activate this?

Professional photos/videos: I'll provide these later. For now, use placeholder screenshots or simple mockups. OK?

Email notification settings: Should we let users opt out of trial reminder emails? Or keep them mandatory (recommended)?

Settings page: Should subscription info be in a dedicated "Billing" page or just a section in Settings? (I suggest Settings section to keep it simple)

Mobile apps: Are iOS/Android apps ready, or should we focus on web-first for launch?

✅ WHAT THIS ACHIEVES:
✅ Professional landing page with authentic messaging
✅ Clear value proposition (flat pricing, unlimited users)
✅ Mission-driven brand (20% to missionaries)
✅ Smart onboarding (trial starts on first project)
✅ Gentle trial enforcement (soft block, not aggressive)
✅ Proper Stripe integration with webhooks
✅ 2-week grace period for failed payments
✅ User-friendly subscription management
🚀 TIMELINE ESTIMATE:
Based on your earlier estimate of 4-6 hours total:

Landing page: 1-2 hours
Onboarding flow: 1 hour
Trial logic: 1-2 hours
Stripe integration: 1-2 hours
Total: ~4-6 hours of focused work

Once you complete each phase, let me know and I can test/provide feedback!

📸 NEXT STEPS FOR ME:
I'll provide professional photography/videography when ready
I'll create Stripe account and provide API keys
I'll test everything once built
I'll provide feedback on design/UX
Let's build this! Start with the landing page - that's the foundation everything else builds on. 🚀
