Hey! Now that we're close to having the domain live, I want to understand the current state of FieldSnaps and plan out the landing page + monetization strategy.

🔍 What's Currently Built?
Current User Experience:

What does a visitor see at https://fieldsnaps.com when NOT logged in?

Is there a marketing/landing page?
Or does it go straight to login/signup?
Can you describe or show me the current homepage?
What's the signup flow right now?

Sign up → immediate access?
Sign up → free trial → paid?
Sign up → just free forever?
Stripe Integration Status: 3. Is Stripe already integrated?

I see Stripe customer IDs and subscription tables in the database
Are Stripe API keys already in Secrets?
What's implemented vs what's prepared for future use?
What payment flows currently work?
Can users subscribe to paid plans?
Is there a checkout process?
Are webhooks handling subscription events?
Can users manage subscriptions?
Trial & Subscription Logic: 5. How does the trial system work?

Email templates mention 7-day trials
Is this enforced in code?
What happens when trial expires?
What subscription features are ready?
Trial reminders (3-day, 1-day before expiration)
Payment success/failure handling
Subscription cancellation flow
Billing management
🎯 What We Want to Build
Our soft launch plan:

Target User Journey:

Visitor → Landing Page → "Start Free Trial" → 
Sign Up (no credit card) → 7 Days Free Access → 
Trial Ending Reminders → Stripe Checkout → Paid Subscription
Landing Page Needs:

Professional marketing homepage
Clear value proposition for field services
Feature highlights with screenshots
Pricing section (Free Trial + Pro Plan pricing)
"Start Free Trial" CTA button
Social proof section (when we have testimonials)
Footer with links
Monetization Strategy:

Free Trial: 7 days, full access, no credit card required
Pro Plan: $XX/month (we need to decide pricing)
Trial-to-Paid Conversion: Email reminders → Stripe checkout
Payment Required: After trial expires to continue using
❓ Questions for You:
What's already built that we can use? Landing page? Stripe integration? Trial logic?

What needs to be added? Should I create a new landing page route? Set up Stripe from scratch?

Do you recommend using:

Stripe Checkout (hosted by Stripe - easiest)
Stripe Elements (custom payment form)
Stripe Customer Portal (for subscription management)
Current authentication: How does Replit Auth work with trials and subscriptions? Does it track trial status?

What's the fastest path to launch? What's the minimum we need to:

Have a professional landing page
Collect payments after trial
Handle the trial → paid conversion
🚀 Our Timeline:
Domain verification: Should complete in next few hours
Soft launch goal: Get first 10-50 users on free trials
Revenue goal: Convert 20-30% of trial users to paid
What's the best approach to build this out efficiently? Should we focus on landing page first, or get Stripe working first, or both in parallel?

Thanks for the guidance! 🙏
