Hey! Thanks for clarifying the database setup. I now understand I'm already using Replit's PostgreSQL (Neon-backed) with Drizzle ORM, so I don't need Supabase. I've already canceled the Supabase Pro subscription.

What I've Completed So Far for Soft Launch:

✅ Domain DNS Configuration (fieldsnaps.com)

Configured all DNS records at Cloudflare
A record pointing to 13.248.243.5 (Proxied)
CNAME records for www, subdomains
MX records for Google Workspace email
NS records: ns19/ns20.domaincontrol.com
SPF and DMARC records configured
✅ Postmark Email Service Setup

Account created and configured
Added DKIM record: 20251016002242pm._domainkey (TXT)
Added Return-Path record: pm-bounces CNAME → pm.mtasv.net (DNS only, not proxied)
Currently waiting 2-48 hours for DNS propagation and verification
Ready for transactional emails once verified
❌ Supabase Pro - Canceled (realized we're already using Replit PostgreSQL)

Next Steps - Services Still Needed:

⏳ Cloudinary Advanced - For photo/video storage, optimization, and CDN delivery

Need this for field inspection photos/videos
Upgrading from free/basic tier
⏳ Sentry Business - For error tracking and performance monitoring

Production error monitoring
Performance insights
Questions for You:

Cloudinary Integration: Do I already have Cloudinary configured in the FieldSnaps app? If so, what tier am I currently on, and what environment variables do I need to update when I upgrade to Advanced?

Sentry Integration: Is Sentry already integrated in the codebase? If so, what configuration changes do I need when upgrading to Business tier?

Postmark Integration: Once DNS verification completes (2-48 hours), what environment variables or configuration do I need to update to connect Postmark for transactional emails?

Domain Connection: Do I need to update any environment variables in Replit to connect fieldsnaps.com to the app? Or is that handled separately?

Soft Launch Readiness: Besides these service upgrades, what else needs to be configured or tested before we're ready for soft launch?

I want to make sure we coordinate properly so nothing breaks when I upgrade these services. Let me know what's already configured and what I need to update!
