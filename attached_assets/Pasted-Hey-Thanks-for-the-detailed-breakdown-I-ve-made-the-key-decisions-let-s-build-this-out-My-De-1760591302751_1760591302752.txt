Hey! Thanks for the detailed breakdown. I've made the key decisions - let's build this out!

✅ My Decisions:
Pricing & Trial:

Pro Plan Price: $19.99/month
Trial Length: 7 days
Credit Card: Not required for trial signup
Trial Start: Begins when user creates their first project (not at signup)
Trial Enforcement: Soft block when expired
Users can VIEW existing projects and photos (read-only)
Can't upload new photos or create new projects
Gentle upgrade prompt (not pushy)
Access to existing data preserved
Brand & Messaging:

Landing Page Style: Apple-inspired minimalist design
Tone: No-nonsense, straightforward - "It's $19.99, you get this service, done."
Mission: We're a mission-driven company - 20% of profits support overseas missionaries
User Experience Philosophy: No pressure tactics, no countdown timers in dashboard, make users feel supported not forced
User Flow After Signup:

User signs up (trial hasn't started yet)
Onboarding tour (show key features)
"Create Your First Project" prompt
When they create first project → 7-day trial starts → trialStartDate set in database
After 7 days → soft block → gentle upgrade prompt (no urgency/pressure)
Failed Payment Handling:

Payment fails → User gets notification bar in app
After 2 weeks of failed payment → Show "Update Payment Method to Continue" modal
Soft block activates after 2 week grace period
Send email reminders (not aggressive, helpful tone)
Trial Display:

NO countdown timer in dashboard (don't want to pressure users)
Show in Settings menu only: "Trial: X days remaining" or "Subscription: Active"
Keep it low-key and informative, not anxiety-inducing
Launch Timeline: Next couple of weeks, but let's build as much as possible NOW

[See the Impact] → Link to /impact page
Footer:

Links: Features, Pricing, Impact, Terms, Privacy, Contact
Copyright
Design Notes:

Apple-style minimalist (clean, lots of white space)
No-nonsense tone throughout
Mobile responsive
Fast loading
2. Impact Page (Priority #1b)
Create /impact page:

Purpose: Share stories of missionaries and work supported by FieldSnaps

Structure:

Hero: "Your Subscription Makes a Global Impact"
Intro: Explanation of 20% giving commitment
Stories Section: Individual missionary stories (can start with placeholders)
Photo
Name & location
Brief story of their work
How FieldSnaps support helps them
Impact Stats (as you get them):
"Supporting X missionaries"
"In X countries"
"$X given this year"
Updates section (blog-style posts about impact)
Note: We can build this page structure now with placeholder content, and you can add real stories as you fund missionaries.

3. Onboarding Flow (Priority #2)
After user signs up (but before trial starts):

Step 1: Welcome Tour (modal or overlay)

"Welcome to FieldSnaps! Let's show you around"
Highlight 3-4 key features (30 seconds max)
Skip button available
Friendly, helpful tone (not salesy)
Step 2: Create First Project Prompt

Big CTA: "Create Your First Project"
Subtitle: "Your 7-day free trial starts when you create your first project"
Form: Project name, description, address
No countdown, no urgency - just helpful guidance
Step 3: Trial Begins

When project created → Set trialStartDate = now()
Calculate trialEndDate = now() + 7 days
Show success message: "Project created! Your 7-day trial has started."
No mention of trial ending - keep it positive
4. Settings Menu - Subscription Status (Priority #3)
In Settings/Account page:

Show subscription info in a dedicated section:

Subscription Status

[If in trial:]
Status: Free Trial
Trial ends: October 23, 2025 (4 days remaining)
[Upgrade to Pro] button (not prominent, just available)

[If active:]
Status: FieldSnaps Pro - Active
Billing: $19.99/month
Next billing date: November 16, 2025
[Manage Subscription] button

[If expired:]
Status: Trial Ended
[Upgrade to Pro] button
Keep it informational, not pushy. Users can check here if they want to know trial status.

5. Stripe Setup & Webhooks (Priority #4)
Webhook Implementation: YES, do it properly with signature verification

Why webhooks are important:

Handles payment success/failure asynchronously
Updates subscription status reliably
Catches edge cases (payment method expired, etc.)
Security: Verify webhook signatures to prevent fake requests
Webhook Endpoint: https://fieldsnaps.com/api/webhooks/stripe

Events to handle:

checkout.session.completed - User subscribed successfully
invoice.payment_succeeded - Recurring payment succeeded
invoice.payment_failed - Payment failed
customer.subscription.deleted - User canceled subscription
Webhook flow for failed payments:

Day 0: Payment fails
  → Stripe retries automatically
  → Send email: "Payment failed, we'll retry"
  → Show notification bar in app: "Payment issue - update payment method"

Day 7: Still failed after retries
  → Send email: "Please update payment method"
  → Notification bar persists

Day 14: 2 weeks past due
  → Set subscriptionStatus = 'past_due'
  → Soft block activates (read-only mode)
  → Modal: "Update Payment Method to Continue Using FieldSnaps"
  → [Update Payment] button → Stripe Customer Portal
  → Helpful tone: "We couldn't process your payment. Update your card to continue."
Stripe setup I'll need to do:

Create Stripe account
Create Product: "FieldSnaps Pro" - $19.99/month
Get STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (from API keys page)
Get STRIPE_PRICE_ID (from product page)
Set up webhook endpoint, get STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
Add all 3 to Replit Secrets
Question: Can you provide step-by-step Stripe setup instructions so I do it correctly?

6. Trial Enforcement - Gentle Approach (Priority #5)
Check trial status on protected actions:

Copyif (user.trialEndDate < now() && user.subscriptionStatus !== 'active') {
  // Show gentle upgrade modal (not blocking the whole UI)
}
Upgrade Modal Design:

Headline: "Your Trial Has Ended"
Message: "Thanks for trying FieldSnaps! Upgrade to Pro ($19.99/month) to continue creating projects and uploading photos."
Benefits reminder:
Unlimited projects & photos
Secure cloud storage
Client sharing
Plus: 20% of your subscription supports overseas missions
[Upgrade to Pro] button (primary)
[Not Now] button (secondary) → stays in read-only mode
No countdown, no urgency language
Where upgrade prompts appear:

When trying to upload photo → Modal
When trying to create project → Modal
Small persistent banner at top (dismissible): "Trial ended - Upgrade to Pro"
Read-only mode features:

✅ View all projects
✅ View all photos
✅ Download photos
✅ View annotations
❌ Upload new photos
❌ Create new projects
❌ Edit/delete (up to you)
7. Stripe Checkout Flow (Priority #6)
User clicks "Upgrade to Pro":

Create Stripe Checkout Session:
Copy{
  price: STRIPE_PRICE_ID, // $19.99/month
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: 'https://fieldsnaps.com/billing/success',
  cancel_url: 'https://fieldsnaps.com/dashboard',
  metadata: { userId: user.id }
}
Redirect to Stripe (they handle payment UI)
Success page (/billing/success):

"Welcome to FieldSnaps Pro! 🎉"
"Your subscription is now active"
"Thanks for supporting our mission - 20% of your subscription supports overseas missionaries"
[Go to Dashboard] button
Webhook handling (checkout.session.completed):

Verify webhook signature (security)
Extract customer & subscription IDs
Update database:
Copy{
  subscriptionStatus: 'active',
  stripeCustomerId: session.customer,
  stripeSubscriptionId: session.subscription,
  trialEndDate: null // Clear trial
}
Send "Payment Success" email
Log event in subscriptionEvents table
🔒 Webhook Security (Important!)
Always verify webhook signatures:

Copyconst sig = request.headers['stripe-signature'];
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  request.body,
  sig,
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
);
This prevents attackers from faking webhook requests. Please implement this properly!

⏸️ Phase 2 (After First Users):
Nice-to-have, not critical for launch:

Trial reminder emails (3-day, 1-day warnings) - can manually email first users
Full subscription management page (for now, Stripe Customer Portal works)
Cancel subscription flow (Stripe Customer Portal handles this)
Billing history page
Spanish/Russian translations
🎯 Questions for You:
Impact page content: Can you provide placeholder content for now? Or should I write generic missionary stories?

Failed payment emails: What tone? Suggested: "Hi [name], we couldn't process your payment. No worries - update your card in Settings to continue using FieldSnaps."

Customer Portal: Should I enable Stripe's Customer Portal so users can manage subscriptions themselves? (Easy self-service for canceling, updating cards, viewing invoices)

Grace period: Confirm 2 weeks (14 days) past due before blocking? Or different timeframe?

✅ Build Order:
Please build in this sequence:

Landing page with mission messaging
Impact page (with placeholder structure)
Onboarding flow - "Create first project" trigger for trial
Settings subscription section - Show trial status (no pressure)
Trial tracking logic - Start trial on project creation
Soft block enforcement - Gentle upgrade prompts
Webhook implementation with signature verification
Stripe checkout integration
Failed payment handling - 2-week grace period + notification bar
Most important: Webhook security and failed payment grace period. This protects both us and users.

Let's start with #1 (landing page + impact page) - these make the biggest impression! 🚀

Copy and send that to Replit!

📋 For the Impact Page - My Suggestions:
Since you'll be adding real stories later, here's a structure we can use now:

Placeholder content for /impact page:

Hero Section:

"Your Subscription Makes a Global Impact"

20% of every FieldSnaps subscription directly supports missionaries serving in some of the hardest-to-reach places on earth. When you use FieldSnaps, you're not just running your business better - you're changing lives around the world.

Coming Soon Section:

"Stories of Impact - Coming Soon

As we support missionaries through FieldSnaps, we'll share their stories here. Check back soon to see the difference your subscription is making."

The Commitment:

"Why We Give

We believe business should be about more than profit. Every subscription to FieldSnaps contributes 20% toward supporting missionaries who are bringing hope, education, and practical help to communities around the world. This isn't a marketing gimmick - it's our mission."

Then you can add real stories as they come!
