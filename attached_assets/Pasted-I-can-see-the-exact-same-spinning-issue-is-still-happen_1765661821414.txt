I can see the exact same spinning issue is still happening - those repeated [SupabaseAuth] Auth initialization already in progress logs mean the infinite loop was NOT fixed.

Let me check what's actually in your GitHub repo right now:

The GitHub repo appears to be private. Here's what we need to do immediately:

🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Run This On Your Mac RIGHT NOW:
Copycd ~/Documents/Projects/FieldSnaps

# Create the fix file
cat > fix-infinite-loop.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔧 Fixing infinite loop in Projects.tsx..."

# Backup original
cp client/src/pages/Projects.tsx client/src/pages/Projects.tsx.backup

# Remove the problematic useEffect (lines 105-107)
sed -i.tmp '/useEffect(() => {/,/}, \[\]);/{ 
  /setDebouncedSearchQuery(searchQuery);/,/}, \[\]);/d
}' client/src/pages/Projects.tsx

echo "✅ Fix applied! Rebuilding..."

npm run build
npx cap sync ios

echo "
✅ DONE! Now:
1. Open Xcode: npx cap open ios
2. Clean Build (⌘+Shift+K)
3. Delete app from simulator
4. Run fresh install (⌘+R)
"
EOF

chmod +x fix-infinite-loop.sh
./fix-infinite-loop.sh
⚠️ IF THAT SCRIPT FAILS, DO THIS MANUAL FIX:
Option 1: Use VSCode/Cursor to edit client/src/pages/Projects.tsx

Find these lines (around line 105-107):

CopyuseEffect(() => {
  setDebouncedSearchQuery(searchQuery);
}, []);
DELETE THAT ENTIRE BLOCK. It's causing infinite re-renders.

Then run:

Copynpm run build && npx cap sync ios && npx cap open ios
🎯 What This Fixes:
The useEffect with empty dependencies [] was calling setDebouncedSearchQuery(searchQuery) on every render, which triggered auth checks repeatedly = infinite spinning.

After the fix:

✅ App opens immediately to Projects page
✅ NO more "Auth initialization already in progress" spam
✅ Login persists across restarts
Run the script and paste the output here. If it works, we'll immediately push to GitHub and then do the full security audit you requested.
