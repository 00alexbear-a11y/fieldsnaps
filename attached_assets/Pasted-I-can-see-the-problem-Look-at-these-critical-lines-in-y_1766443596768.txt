I can see the problem! Look at these critical lines in your logs:

🔴 [✨  CapgoUpdater]: Error checksum 2ca364c29be5034dd1d26aa75aef59f0d336e690a5af24c41c308c498b7608e9 a234c8ae
🟢 [✨  CapgoUpdater]: Stats sent for checksum_fail, version 1.0.1
🟢 [✨  CapgoUpdater]: Stats sent for download_fail, version builtin
The OTA update is FAILING due to checksum mismatch! The app is still running the old "builtin" version, NOT the new version with the getUser() fix.

🔴 Root Cause:
Capgo downloads new version 1.0.1
Checksum validation fails (corrupted download or build issue)
Update is rejected and deleted
App continues running old "builtin" version
Your getUser() fix never reaches the app!
✅ Solution: Force a Clean Rebuild
Send this to Replit:

🚀 FORCE CLEAN REBUILD & REDEPLOY
The Capgo OTA update is failing due to checksum mismatch. We need to force a clean rebuild.

Step 1: Verify the getUser() fix was deployed to GitHub
Run in Replit Shell:

git log --oneline -1

This should show your most recent commit with the getUser() fix.
If it doesn't, the fix wasn't committed. Run:

git add server/storage.ts
git commit -m "Fix getUser() to hydrate subscriptionStatus from company"
git push origin main

Step 2: Trigger a clean Capgo build
Go to https://capgo.app/dashboard

1. Click on your app (com.fieldsnaps.app)
2. Find the "production" channel
3. Click "Force New Build" or "Invalidate Cache"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for new build

Step 3: If Capgo doesn't have a force build option, use version bump
In package.json, bump the version:

Change:
"version": "1.0.1"

To:
"version": "1.0.2"

Then:
git add package.json
git commit -m "Bump version to force clean build"
git push origin main

Step 4: Check Capgo build status
Go to https://capgo.app/dashboard
Wait for build to show "Success" status

Step 5: Test on iOS again
1. Force quit FieldSnaps app
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Reopen app
4. Check logs for:
   - "Current is: 1.0.2" (or new version number)
   - No "checksum_fail" errors
   - Update should succeed

Step 6: Verify Trial Mode is gone
After successful update, check:
✅ No "Trial Mode" banner
✅ Camera button works
✅ Subscription shows "active"

If update still fails with checksum error, we'll need to rebuild the iOS app in Xcode (nuclear option).

Report back the results!
The issue is NOT your code - it's the OTA update mechanism failing. Your getUser() fix is correct, but it's not reaching the device because Capgo keeps rejecting the update.
