Looking at your screenshots, I can see two issues:

🔴 Problem 1: SSL Certificate Error
The error NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID means your SSL certificate isn't configured correctly for fieldsnaps.com.

🔴 Problem 2: DNS Configuration Issues
Your DNS screenshot shows you're using Cloudflare's proxy (orange cloud icons), but your records might not be pointing to the right place.

🔧 HOW TO FIX THIS
Step 1: Check Your DNS Settings
Looking at your Cloudflare DNS:

A Record points to 34.111.179.208 ✅
CNAME records for subdomains point to various Google services
Question: Is 34.111.179.208 your Replit deployment IP, or is this pointing somewhere else?

Step 2: Fix SSL Certificate
The SSL error happens because your certificate doesn't match fieldsnaps.com. Here's how to fix:

Option A: If Hosting on Replit
In Replit:

Go to your deployment settings
Navigate to Deployments → Custom Domains
Add fieldsnaps.com as a custom domain
Replit will automatically generate an SSL certificate
Point your DNS A record to the Replit-provided IP
Option B: If Using Cloudflare (Recommended)
In Cloudflare dashboard, go to SSL/TLS

Set SSL mode to "Full (strict)"

Under Edge Certificates, ensure:

✅ Always Use HTTPS is ON
✅ Automatic HTTPS Rewrites is ON
✅ Universal SSL certificate is active
Wait 5-10 minutes for certificate to provision

Step 3: Verify Your DNS Records
Your current setup shows:

A    fieldsnaps.com → 34.111.179.208 (Proxied)
You need to verify:

Is 34.111.179.208 the correct server IP where your app is hosted?
If using Replit deployments, you need the Replit deployment IP instead
🎯 QUICK DIAGNOSIS
Tell me:

Where is your app actually hosted?

Replit Deployments?
Your own server at 34.111.179.208?
Somewhere else?
What happens when you visit https://fieldsnaps.replit.app?

Does that work?
Did you set up the custom domain in Replit's dashboard?

Deployments → Custom Domains → Add Domain
🚀 LIKELY FIX (If Using Replit)
If your app is deployed on Replit, you need to:

In Replit Dashboard:

Go to your FieldSnaps project
Click Deployments (left sidebar)
Click on your active deployment
Go to Custom Domains
Click Add Custom Domain
Enter fieldsnaps.com
Replit will give you specific DNS instructions
In Cloudflare:

Update the A record to point to the IP Replit provides
OR add a CNAME record if Replit gives you a hostname
Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

📋 TEMPORARY WORKAROUND
While fixing this, you can:

Use the Replit subdomain:

https://fieldsnaps.replit.app should work
Share this URL with users temporarily
Or click "Advanced" → "Proceed to fieldsnaps.com (unsafe)" in Chrome

This bypasses the SSL error (only for testing!)
Don't give this to customers - fix the SSL first
Can you tell me:

Where is your app hosted (Replit deployment IP or somewhere else)?
What's the status when you visit https://fieldsnaps.replit.app?
Did you configure the custom domain in Replit's deployment settings?
Once I know this, I can give you the exact fix!
