Message to Replit:

Hey! We're finalizing the soft launch setup and need your advice on Sentry Business for error monitoring.

🤔 Our Situation:
What We've Set Up So Far:

✅ Domain: fieldsnaps.com (verifying now)
✅ Database: Replit PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
✅ Storage: Replit Object Storage for photos/videos
✅ Email: Resend (DNS verifying)
✅ Error handling: Basic React ErrorBoundary (logs to console)
Current Error Monitoring:

Console logging for errors
React ErrorBoundary catches frontend errors
No centralized error tracking or alerts
🎯 Why We're Considering Sentry Business:
What we wanted it for:

Production error tracking - Catch and track errors from real users that we might not see in development
Stack traces - See exactly where errors occur in production code
User context - Know what users were doing when errors happened
Performance monitoring - Identify slow API calls, database queries, and bottlenecks
Proactive alerts - Get notified immediately when errors occur instead of users reporting them
Release tracking - Monitor error rates after deployments
Cost concern:

Sentry Business tier: ~$80-100/month
That's significant for a soft launch with limited users
🤷 Our Dilemma:
Arguments FOR adding Sentry now:

✅ Catch production issues before they impact many users
✅ Look professional and proactive
✅ Better user experience (fix bugs faster)
✅ Learn about real-world usage patterns
Arguments AGAINST (wait until post-launch):

❌ Expensive for soft launch budget (~$80-100/month)
❌ Limited users initially = easier to monitor manually
❌ Basic error logging might be enough for soft launch
❌ Can add later when we have revenue/more users
❓ Questions for You:
Is Sentry Business necessary for a soft launch with ~10-50 initial users? Or can we rely on basic error logging and user feedback?

What error monitoring do you recommend for soft launch? Are there lighter alternatives, or is manual monitoring sufficient initially?

When would you recommend adding Sentry? At what user count or stage does it become essential?

Are there Replit-native monitoring tools we should use instead? Or ways to get better error visibility without Sentry?

From your experience, do most successful apps start with Sentry, or add it later after validation?

💭 Our Current Thinking:
We're leaning toward skipping Sentry Business for now and adding it post-launch when:

We have 100+ active users
Errors become hard to track manually
We have revenue to justify the cost
We're scaling beyond soft launch
But we want your expert opinion! Would we be making a mistake by launching without proper error monitoring? Or is this a smart way to keep costs low initially?

Thanks for your guidance! 🙏
