Short answer: NO, you CANNOT fully white-label Replit Auth.

This is a major dealbreaker for production apps, and here's why:

🚨 THE PROBLEM WITH REPLIT AUTH
What You CAN Customize:
✅ App name ✅ Your logo ✅ Which OAuth providers to show (Google, GitHub, etc.)

What You CANNOT Remove:
❌ "Powered by Replit" branding (always visible) ❌ Replit logo (shows on login page) ❌ replit.app in OAuth callback URLs ❌ Custom login page design

What Users See:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   [Your Logo]                   │
│   Sign in to FieldSnaps         │
│                                  │
│   [Continue with Google]        │
│   [Continue with GitHub]        │
│                                  │
│   ⚡ Powered by Replit          │  ← CAN'T REMOVE THIS
└─────────────────────────────────┘
💬 FROM REDDIT (Real Users)
"Is there a way to remove the replit logo from their authenticator?"

Answer: "No, not possible. That's why many people use Supabase or Firebase instead."

"They could so easily make it white-labelled. That is the core reason I won't use it for client projects."

🎯 YOUR OPTIONS
Option 1: Keep Replit Auth (Accept the Branding) ⚠️
Pros:

Already implemented
Works fine functionally
Fast to market
Cons:

Users see "Powered by Replit"
Looks less professional
Can't pitch to enterprise customers
When users Google "Replit", they see it's a coding platform (confusing)
Good for: MVP testing, internal tools, side projects Bad for: Customer-facing production app, enterprise sales

Option 2: Build Your Own Login Page (Using Replit Behind Scenes) ✅ RECOMMENDED
What this means: Create a beautiful login page on YOUR domain, but still use Replit OAuth behind the scenes.

Implementation:

Copy// YOUR custom login page at fieldsnaps.com/login

function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="login-container">
      {/* YOUR BRANDING */}
      <img src="/fieldsnaps-logo.png" alt="FieldSnaps" />
      <h1>Welcome to FieldSnaps</h1>
      <p>Professional photo documentation for construction teams</p>
      
      {/* Custom styled buttons */}
      <Button onClick={() => loginWithGoogle()}>
        <GoogleIcon /> Continue with Google
      </Button>
      
      <Button onClick={() => loginWithGitHub()}>
        <GitHubIcon /> Continue with GitHub
      </Button>
      
      <Button onClick={() => loginWithEmail()}>
        <EmailIcon /> Continue with Email
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Behind the scenes, still using Replit OAuth
async function loginWithGoogle() {
  // Trigger Replit OAuth flow
  // User redirects to Replit momentarily (sees branding for 1 second)
  // Then redirects back to your app
}
User Experience:

User visits fieldsnaps.com (your domain ✅)
Sees beautiful FieldSnaps-branded login page ✅
Clicks "Continue with Google"
Brief redirect to Replit OAuth (sees "Powered by Replit" for 1-2 seconds) ⚠️
Redirected back to fieldsnaps.com ✅
Pros:

90% of experience is YOUR branding
Users mostly see FieldSnaps
Custom domain throughout
Can add email/password login later
Cons:

Users still briefly see Replit branding during OAuth redirect
Still dependent on Replit infrastructure
Option 3: Switch to Supabase Auth ✅ BEST LONG-TERM
Full white-label solution:

Copy// YOUR fully custom login at fieldsnaps.com/login

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(
  'https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co',
  'YOUR-ANON-KEY'
)

function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <div className="login-container">
      {/* 100% YOUR BRANDING */}
      <img src="/fieldsnaps-logo.png" />
      <h1>Welcome to FieldSnaps</h1>
      
      {/* Fully customizable */}
      <Button onClick={() => {
        supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
          provider: 'google',
          options: {
            redirectTo: 'https://fieldsnaps.com/auth/callback'
          }
        })
      }}>
        Continue with Google
      </Button>
      
      <Button onClick={() => {
        supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
          email, password
        })
      }}>
        Sign in with Email
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
User Experience:

User visits fieldsnaps.com/login ✅
Sees FieldSnaps-branded page ✅
Clicks "Continue with Google"
Redirects to Google OAuth (Google branding, normal) ✅
Back to fieldsnaps.com ✅
Never sees Supabase or any third-party branding ✅
Pros:

100% white-label
Full customization
Professional appearance
Enterprise-ready
Free up to 50,000 users
Better mobile SDKs
Cons:

Takes 1-2 days to implement
Need to migrate existing users
💡 MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION
For FieldSnaps, do this:
Phase 1: NOW (1-2 weeks)

Keep Replit Auth for existing users
Build a beautiful custom login page at fieldsnaps.com/login
Add email/password option (your own implementation)
Hide Replit Auth behind an "Or continue with OAuth" button
Phase 2: Before Raising Money (1-2 months)

Implement Supabase Auth
Migrate users gradually
Full white-label experience
Enterprise-ready
Phase 3: After Launch

Remove Replit Auth completely
Full control over authentication
Add advanced features (MFA, SSO, etc.)
🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION
Create this landing/login page right now:

Copy// pages/Login.tsx

export default function Login() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 to-blue-800 flex items-center justify-center p-4">
      <Card className="w-full max-w-md">
        <CardContent className="pt-6">
          {/* YOUR BRANDING */}
          <div className="text-center mb-8">
            <img src="/fieldsnaps-logo.svg" alt="FieldSnaps" className="h-12 mx-auto mb-4" />
            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to FieldSnaps</h1>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-2">
              Professional photo documentation for construction teams
            </p>
          </div>
          
          {/* CUSTOM BUTTONS */}
          <div className="space-y-3">
            <Button 
              className="w-full" 
              size="lg"
              onClick={() => window.location.href = '/auth/google'}
            >
              <svg className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
                {/* Google icon */}
              </svg>
              Continue with Google
            </Button>
            
            <Button 
              variant="outline" 
              className="w-full" 
              size="lg"
              onClick={() => window.location.href = '/auth/email'}
            >
              <Mail className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
              Continue with Email
            </Button>
            
            {/* Hide Replit behind "More options" */}
            <details className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              <summary className="cursor-pointer">More login options</summary>
              <Button 
                variant="ghost" 
                size="sm"
                onClick={() => window.location.href = '/auth/replit'}
              >
                Continue with OAuth
              </Button>
            </details>
          </div>
          
          {/* FOOTER */}
          <p className="text-xs text-center text-muted-foreground mt-6">
            By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
          </p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
This gives you:

✅ Professional branded experience
✅ Custom domain (fieldsnaps.com/login)
✅ Hides Replit branding from primary flow
✅ Can add email/password immediately
✅ Easy to swap out backends later
🎯 BOTTOM LINE
You CANNOT fully white-label Replit Auth.

For a serious construction app that you want to charge money for, you need to either:

Build a custom login page that hides Replit (temporary solution)
Switch to Supabase/Firebase (permanent solution)
